# Indy TLS for OpenSSL

This project implements TLS and Hash functionalities for Indy using OpenSSL as the backend library.

It is split off from the main Indy library so it can be updated independantly to the latest version of OpenSSL.

It should be usable as an additional package/dropin to Indy, as long as it remains compatible with Indy's SSLIOHandler and IdFIPS interfaces.

Once this project is stable, the corresponding files will be removed from Indy's main Protocols package, the USE_OPENSSL conditional will be removed from Indy's source files, etc.  This requires Indy 10.7 or later, otherwise it will conflict with the OpenSSL files thaat are present in older Indy versions.

Not sure at this time whether this project will stay as an independant repo, or if it will eventually be merged back into the main Indy repo as a sub-folder.  But either way, this project will stay as a separate package moving forward.
